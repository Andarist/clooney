```

## Quickstart

An example says more than 1000 words:

```html
<script src="/clooney.bundle.js"></script>
<script>
  (async function() {
    class MyRemoteClass {
      doExpensiveCalculation(a, b) {
        return a + b;
      }
    }

    const instance = await Clooney.spawn(MyRemoteClass);
    console.log(await instance.doExepensiveCalculation(5, 23));
  })();
</script>
```
